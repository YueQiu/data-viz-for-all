# data-viz-for-all
Best practices for mobile, accessible interactives. Brought to you by SRCCON 2015.

Let’s brainstorm some best practices for building better interactives. How can we make data viz more mobile-friendly? How can we make it more accessible for assistive technologies? Let’s go beyond our standard desktop designs and think about ways to create engaging, data-driven experiences for all. We’ll start with some existing examples and areas of focus – and we want to hear from you about your favorite creative and effective ways to design news apps and graphics for a broader audience. By the end of the session, we’ll compile everyone’s ideas into a living document for future reference.
